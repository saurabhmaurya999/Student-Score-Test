## 🚀 Project Overview

Educational institutions can benefit from early prediction of student performance to provide timely support and improve learning outcomes.  
In this project, we apply multiple regression algorithms and compare their performance using **cross-validation**.

## 🔁 Model Evaluation Strategy

- **K-Fold Cross Validation (CV = 3)**
- Evaluation Metric:
  - **R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)**

> ⚠️ Since this is a regression problem, accuracy is **not used**.
